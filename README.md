# [Reasoning and Sampling-Augmented MCQ Difficulty Prediction via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08551)

In this repository, we present the code to our paper "Reasoning and Sampling-Augmented MCQ Difficulty Prediction via LLMs" by Wanyong Feng, Peter Tran, Stephen Sireci, and Andrew Lan. In this work, we propose a novel method to predict the difficulty value of math MCQs. Our method first augments the reasoning steps and feedback messages for each option, then samples student knowledge profiles from a distribution, and finally predicts the likelihood of each option being selected and use it to predict the MCQâ€™s difficulty.

For any questions please [email](mailto:wanyongfeng@umass.edu) or raise an issue.
